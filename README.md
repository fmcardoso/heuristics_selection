# Dynamics of heuristics selection for cooperative behaviour

Code used in the simulations. For practical reasons, the code was written to be compiled by the icc 13.0.0  compiler. For this reason, it has its own version of a random helper (`MyRandom`). If used by new versions of the gcc (recommended), the `random` library can be used.  In any case, c++11 compiler works fine with the current version.

#### TODO List:

- Add executions examples. 
- Improve documentation.
